Check `localhost:5000` to see the website.

## `integrate` branch
Application runs on Vite-based React Frontend and Flask Backend.

### Run the Frontend Server
1.) `npm i`

2.) `npm run dev`

---

Frontend URL: `localhost:5173`

Backend URL: `localhost:5000`

### API Documentation

This document provides detailed information about the API endpoints available in the Flask application. It includes endpoint purposes, request methods, query parameters, response formats and sample outputs.

---

#### Overview

The API is built using Flask and connects to a MongoDB database (`meteo`) with a collection named `test`. It is designed to serve meteorological data and supports Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) with the allowed origin set to `http://localhost:5173`.

The application includes three main endpoints:

- **Root Endpoint (`/`)**: Serves a static HTML page about the server status.
- **By Station Endpoint (`/by_station`)**: Retrieves weather data filtered by a specific station.
- **By Date Endpoint (`/by_date`)**: Retrieves weather data filtered by a specific date.
---

## Endpoints

### 1. Root Endpoint

#### Purpose
- To serve the HTML page (`server.html`) which shows the current status of the Backend Server.

#### Request
- **URL:** `/` 
- **Method:** `GET`  
- **Parameters:** None

#### Response
- **Content:** HTML content rendered from the `server.html` template.
- **HTTP Status Code:** `200 OK` on success.

---

### 2. Get Weather Data by Station

#### Purpose
- Retrieves the weather records for a specific station from the database. The results are returned in chronological order (oldest first after reversing).

#### Request
- **URL:** `/by_station` 
- **Method:** `GET`  
- **Parameters:** station

#### Query Parameters
- **station** (required)
  - **Type:** Integer (passed as a string in the query and then converted to an integer)
  - **Description:** The unique identifier for the station. This parameter is used to filter the records in the database.

#### Error Handling
`400 Bad Request`: If the `station` argument was not received, the server responds with `400 Bad Request`.

`405 Method Not Allowed`: If the server receives an unrecognised HTTP/S Method, it responds with `405 Method Not Allowed`

`500 Internal Server Error`: If the server fails to construct the JSON Response, the server responds with `500 Internal Server Error`

#### Behavior
- The endpoint queries the MongoDB collection for documents where the `"Station"` field matches the provided value.
- The query results are sorted in descending order by the `"Date"` field to capture the most recent records.
- The result set is ordered from oldest to newest.

#### Success Response
- **Content-Type:** `application/json`
- **HTTP Status Code:** `200 OK`
- **Response Body:** A JSON array of documents. Each document includes:
  - `Avg`: Average measurement value.
  - `Date`: Date of the measurement, formatted as `"YYYY-MM-DD"`.
  - `FDAvg`: FDAverage value (context-specific).
  - `Station`: Station identifier.
  - `_id`: Document identifier as a string.
  

**Example Success Response:**
```json
[
  {
    "Avg": 23.5,
    "Date": "2023-03-01",
    "FDAvg": 22.8,
    "Station": 101,
    "_id": "640c1234abcd5678efgh"
  },
  {
    "Avg": 24.1,
    "Date": "2023-03-02",
    "FDAvg": 23.0,
    "Station": 101,
    "_id": "640c2345bcde6789fghi"
  }
]
```

### 3. Get Weather Data by Date

**URL:** `/by_date`  
**Method:** `GET`

#### Purpose
Retrieves all records for a given date from the database, filtering only those records whose `"Station"` field is part of a predefined list (`station_list` imported from the configuration).

#### Request
- **URL:** `/by_date` 
- **Method:** `GET`  
- **Parameters:** date

#### Query Parameters
- **`date`** (required)
  - **Type:** String
  - **Format:** `"YYYY-MM-DD"`
  - **Description:** The date for which records should be retrieved. The endpoint extracts records where the `"Date"` field matches the requested date.

#### Error Handling
`400 Bad Request`: If the `date` argument was not received, the server responds with `400 Bad Request`.

`405 Method Not Allowed`: If the server receives an unrecognised HTTP/S Method, it responds with `405 Method Not Allowed`

`500 Internal Server Error`: If the server fails to construct the JSON Response, the server responds with `500 Internal Server Error`

#### Behavior
- The endpoint parses the provided date string into a datetime object.
- The MongoDB query filters documents where:
  - The `"Date"` field of the document matches the requested date

#### Success Response
- **Content-Type:** `application/json`
- **HTTP Status Code:** `200 OK`
- **Response Body:** A JSON array of documents. Each document includes:
  - `Avg`: Average measurement value.
  - `Date`: Date of the measurement, formatted as `"YYYY-MM-DD"`.
  - `FDAvg`: FDAverage value.
  - `Station`: Station identifier.
  - `_id`: Document identifier as a string.

**Example Success Response:**
```json
[
  {
    "Avg": 22.0,
    "Date": "2023-04-15",
    "FDAvg": 21.5,
    "Station": 102,
    "_id": "640cabcd1234efgh5678"
  },
  {
    "Avg": 30.0,
    "Date": "2023-04-16",
    "FDAvg": 19.5,
    "Station": 105,
    "_id": "046cabcd4321hgfe8765"
  }
]
```
